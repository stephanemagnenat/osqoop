	\section Introduction

	Osqoop is an open source software oscilloscope. This is the developer documentation. It provides:
	- Full cross-linked source documentation (use top links)
	- A \ref ProcessingPluginsCookbook to introduce you into plugins writing
	- A \ref DataSourceCookbook to introduce you into data source writing
	- Informations about compilation (see below)

	\section Compilation

	\subsection Requirements

	To compile Osqoop, you need:
	- Qt 4.0 (minimum) or Qt 4.1 (for all features), including
	qmake, gcc (or mingw32 on Windows) and a working shell.
	Please note that the Windows open source Qt 4.x can install mingw32
	for you.

	In addition, to compile and use the TseAdExt data source, you need:
	- On Unix: libusb
	To run it, you need:
	- On Windows: Cypress EzUSB driver
	- On Unix: fxload

	In addition, to compile the virtual mouse, you need:
	- On Unix: libxtest

	\subsection ChoosingYourPlugins Choosing your plugins

	The distribution of Osqoop comes with all plugins enabled and thus requires
	all aforementioned libraries. If you want to skip compilation of some plugins
	or do not have the required libraries, you can select the ones you want to compile
	by editing the SUBDIRS variable in datasource/DataSource.pro (for data source)
	and processing/Plugins.pro (for plugins).
	
	\subsection Compiling

	The actual compilation is very easy. Execute, in Osqoop base directory:
	- ./configure (or configure.bat in Windows): to recreate the makefiles from the .pro
	- make: to compile the execute from the sources using the makefiles
	On Unix, you also need to call the fixhelperperm script as root (or in sudo)
	after compilation in order to setuid it.

	You can regenerate this documentation using doxygen.

	\subsection Cleaning Cleaning your sources

	Osqoop ships with a some cleaning scripts:
	- makeclean: executing it will clean your sources. It will not remove the generated makefiles
	- makedistclean: call makeclean but also removes generated makefiles
	- makesourcedist: make a .tar.gz for distribution
